# TwitchModBot

A past project for others to reference for a Twitch bot built in NodeJS and uses MySQL. It's patched together for what the community needed, and was in no way meant to be a full, commerical ready product.

**CODE IS PRESENTED AS IS WITH NO SUPPORT AND NO WARRANTY. THIS CODE IS NO LONGER BEING MAINTAINED.**

Good luck with the spaghetti code and messy var scope if you choose to improve/implement this. ðŸ¤ 

*Note:* This code was built and ran with Windows as the OS. YMMV on other OS'es.
